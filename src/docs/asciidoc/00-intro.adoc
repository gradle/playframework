== Introduction

https://www.playframework.com/[Play] is a modern web application framework. The Play plugin adds support for building, testing and running Play applications with Gradle.

[NOTE]
====
This plugin is different from the {uri-gradle-userguide}/play_plugin.html[Play plugin] shipped with the Gradle distribution. It's developed and shipped independently from the Gradle core functionality and does not use the software model. See the <<migrating-from-standard-play-plugin,migration section>> for guidance on moving your project to this plugin.

=== Requirements

The Play plugin defines the following requirements for a consuming build.

* The build has to be run with Java 8 or higher.
* The build has to use Gradle 6.0 or higher.
* The supported Play versions are 2.4.x, 2.5.x and 2.6.x.

=== Limitations

The Play plugin currently has a few limitations.

* The plugin does not yet support aggregate reverse routes introduced in Play 2.4.x.
* A given project may only define a single Play application. This means that a single project cannot build more than one Play application. However, a multi-project build can have many projects that each define their own Play application.
* Support for generating IDE configurations for Play applications is limited to {uri-gradle-userguide}/idea_plugin.html[IDEA].

=== Applying the plugin

To use the Play plugin, include the following in your build script to apply the `org.gradle.playframework` plugin. Currently, the plugin is only available on the https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.gradle.playframework[Gradle plugin portal].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Defining the Lightbend repositories is necessary.
