=== Configuring routes style

If your Play application's router uses dependency injection to access your controllers, you'll need to configure your application to _not_ use the default static router. Under the covers, the Play plugin is using the `InjectedRoutesGenerator` instead of the default `StaticRoutesGenerator` to generate the router classes.

[NOTE]
====
The injected router is only supported in Play Framework 2.4 or better.

[NOTE]
====
In Play Framework 2.7 or better the StaticRoutesGenerator is no more supported. The property injectedRoutesGenerator is not needed.
